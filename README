Please let us know if this README is insufficient, or if you needed to do any installation steps not listed explicitly.

Send an e-mail to Chucky Ellison (celliso2@illinois.edu) with questions/comments/suggestions.  You can also go to http://code.google.com/p/c-semantics/ to submit bug reports or feature requests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Perl
	- You almost definitely will have this installed if you use linux or mac; otherwise, use your package manager to install it
	- Windows perl can be found here: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl
	- Perl is used for many of the scripts in both the C tool and in K
	- Install perl modules (probably using either ppm in windows, or cpan elsewhere)
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Regexp::Common
		- Tree::Nary
		- Text::Diff
		- DBI
		- DBD::SQLite
		- Getopt::Declare
		- File::Spec::Link

Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 ~]$ cpan -i XML::DOM
...
(It might help to do this as sudo if it doesn't work as a normal user)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Ocaml (http://caml.inria.fr/):
	- OCaml is used in the C parser
	- Version 3.11.0 works; probably many others work as well
	
Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 ~]$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.11.0

# 
(press ctrl-d to exit)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Maude:
	- Go to http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/ and install the Maude rewrite system on your machine
	- Best to use the precompiled binaries if you can
	- K requires at least version 2.5
	- Once installed, add its directory to your path, and make sure you can start the tool by running "maude".  This may require you to rename (or alias or ln) the specific executable to "maude".
	- We suggest you make this change "stick" by adding it to your login script.  E.g., if you use the bash shell on linux, you can make this change stay by adding the line "PATH=/path/to/maude/bin:$PATH" to your ~/.bashrc file.
	
Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 ~]$ maude
                     \||||||||||||||||||/
                   --- Welcome to Maude ---
                     /||||||||||||||||||\
            Maude 2.6 built: Dec  9 2010 18:28:39

Maude> q
Bye.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------	
Install K:
	- Go to http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/ and check out the K Semantic Framework from http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/source/checkout
	- Check out https://k-framework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/v2.7 to get the right version
	- You'll definitely want to download the most recent version from SVN instead of using the Downloads link.
	- The requirements given above in this file should satisfy any requirements of K, but you can look at their readme for details.
	- Set K_BASE to the full (non-relative) path in which you installed the K framework.
	-- E.g., run "export K_BASE=~/k-framework/trunk"
	-- We suggest you make this change "stick" by adding it to your login script.  E.g., if you use the bash shell on linux, you can make this change stay by adding the line "export K_MAUDE_BASE=~/k-framework/trunk" to your ~/.bashrc file.
	-- Do NOT include a trailing '/'
	- Try the following examples:
	
Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 k-framework-read-only]$ make test -C examples
...
[celliso2@fsl3 k-framework-read-only]$ make -C regressionTests
...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------	
Optional Install:
	- You may want to install Graphviz (dot), for generating images of the state space when searching programs.
	- You can probably do this with your package manager
	
Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 ~]$ which dot
/usr/bin/dot

-----------------------------------------------------------------------	
Build our C tool:
	- Run "make" in our main directory, the directory of this README
	- This should take between 1 and 5 minutes on non-windows machines, and up to 10 minutes on windows.
	- The "make" process creates a "dist" directory which you can copy elsewhere to install the C tool, or simply leave it where it is.  Either way, you will probably want to add it to your path like you did for Maude above. PATH=/path/to/c-semantics/dist:$PATH
	
Example/Test:
[celliso2@fsl3 c-semantics]$ dist/kcc tests/unitTests/helloworld.c
[celliso2@fsl3 c-semantics]$ ./a.out 
Hello world

	- If you chose to add dist to your path, then you can simply type "kcc" instead of "dist/kcc"
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------	
Understanding the tool:
	- 'kcc' is meant to to act a lot like gcc.  You use it and run programs the same way.
	- The programs kcc generates act like normal programs.  Both the output to stdio (e.g., printf), as well as the return value of the program should be what you expect.  In terms of operational behavior, a correct program compiled with kcc should act the same as one compiled with gcc.
	- Take a look at 'kcc -h' for some compile-time options.  For most programs, you only need to run "kcc program.c" and everything will work.  Caveats below.
	- After compiling a program and generating an output file "a.out", running "HELP=1 ./a.out" will display some runtime options, including SEARCH and PROFILE.
	- If you try to run a program that is undefined (or one for which we are missing semantics), the program will get stuck.  The message should tell you where it got stuck and may give a hint as to why.  If you want help deciphering the output, or help understanding why the program is defined, please send your .kdump file to the e-mail listed at the top of this file.
	
Runtime Features:
	- Running "SEARCH=1 ./a.out" will exhaustively search the state space of your program and generate a .pdf and .ps of the space (if you installed Graphviz).  This is the only way to check all possible evaluation orders of a program to find undefined behavior.  You need to compile your program using the '-n' flag, like "kcc -n program.c" in order to take advantage of this feature.  This feature is currently under development.
	- Running "PROFILE=1 ./a.out" will record which rules of the semantics are exercised during the evaluation of the program.  The program executes as normal, but this additional information is recorded in a SQLite database "maudeProfileDBfile.sqlite" in your current directory.  You can access the information by running queries against the database.  Some sample queries are provided in the dist directory, and can be tried by running, e.g., 
cat dist/profile-executiveSummaryByProgram.sql | perl dist/accessProfiling.pl
	You can look at the provided queries and construct your own, or access the database using your own programs.  Different runs of the tool are kept distinct in the database, so you can run a bunch of programs and then analyze the collective data.  You can simply delete "maudeProfileDBfile.sqlite" file to start another series of tests with a fresh database.

Caveats and Misc:
	- In order to use any file I/O, you need to compile the program with the -i option.  The support for file I/O is still incredibly rudimentary and very few functions are supported.
	- If you are only using one of the standard library functions that we directly give semantics to (printf being the most important), you can prevent the tool from linking in the standard library with the -s option.  This can speed up the execution time of your program.  If the program needs the standard library and you use the -s option, it will simply get stuck and you will see it trying to call that missing function at the top of the computation.

Understanding the semantics

Links to help understand K:
	- http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/
	- http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/K See particularly:
		- Traian Serbanuta's thesis defense slides (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/serbanuta-2010-thesis-slides.pdf) for a high level overview 
		- "An Overview of the K Semantic Framework" from the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/rosu-serbanuta-2010-jlap.pdf) for a detailed explanation
		
Generate pdf versions of the semantics (INCOMPLETE):
	- run 'make pdf'
	- Currently this creates only pdfs in the /semantics directory.  
	- The pdfs are often incorrect, in that they omit necessary parentheses.  Moreover, the semantics is quite messy as we are still experimenting with the best way to represent things and find the most undefined behavior.  However, these pdfs are sufficient for helping build an understanding of the semantics.
